*IMPORTANT* Protocol conditions were changed on 10/04 at 7:00PM EST

In order to coexist better with the Delta MK2 communications protocol, there have been a few changes made to the y0b0tics! Mining Guild Protocol.

The highlights are:
A. In a high capability match sphere ONE will revolve and sphere TWO will spin.
B. In a mixed capability match the high capability sphere will revolve and the low capability sphere will spin. (same as previous)
C. We are now implementing a bitwise communications protocol for the two messages.
D. The bitwise communications protocol will use bit 11 to represent the higher capability sphere and bit 10 to represent the lower capability sphere.

CORRECTION: Sphere 1 - Laser 1, Sphere 2 - Laser 2


If you want to achieve the highest amount of points that you possibly can, you should follow THIS plan. We have only two different codes and two different flight plans depending on your ability to revolve and/or melt. The flight plan that team y0b0tics has developed allows for the HIGHEST POSSIBLE SCORE PER MATCH. One team will get the highest number of points for revolving, and the other team will get the highest number of points for spinning. DOING ANYTHING ELSE WILL LOWER YOUR SCORE. However, ONLY if both teams are not a high capability teams, you may not achieve maximum score.

The philosophy of our plan has two key points. One is that we present the ENTIRE plan, including the specific way points, and the other is that there is NO COIN TOSS. When going into a match you will know EXACTLY what your sphere needs to do in that match, and EXACTLY what the other sphere will be doing during that match. The advantage of using these flight plans is the spheres do not interfere with each other and each action will be completed as efficiently as possible. There will also be no coin toss. Because of a corrupt communications protocol, teams would be able to see another teams toss before they adjust their own, which means that THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FAIR COIN TOSS. Our solution to this problem is using sphere numbers to resolve conflict. 

WE ONLY USE TWO CODES. The first code (bit 11=1) is for the teams that can do everything, including revolving and melting. If you cannot melt, or if you cannot revolve, or if you can neither melt nor revolve, the second code (bit 10=1) is for you. When two teams meet, every match will fall into one of three categories. When time=0, both spheres will send a single message indicating their level of capability. There is no issue of coin toss, so feel free to send this message right away. Once the sphere receives the code from the other sphere it will know exactly what to do just as long as at least one of the spheres can "do everything" (bit 11=1). 

Every match will fall into one of three categories. The first category is “high capability” where both teams are fully capable of completing every necessary action. The second category is“mixed capability” where one team is fully capable of completing all of the necessary actions and the other team isn't. The third category is “low capability” where both teams are not capable of completing all of the necessary actions. We only offer conflict resolution in the last case. 

In a high capability match, both spheres will collect a laser and fly to specific way points listed below. Once Opulens appears, both teams will fire their lasers and once Opulens is fully thawed, one team (sphere 1) will revolve and the other team (sphere 2) will spin. 

In a mixed capability match, one or both spheres will collect a laser and fly to the same specific points listed below. Once Opulens appears, at least one team will fire its laser, and once opulens is fully thawed out, the more capable team will revolve and the less capable team will spin. 

In a low capability match, one team will be given rights to a laser, an asteroid and a mining station and the other team will be given rights to the other laser, asteroid and mining station. 

For teams that ARE capable of revolving and melting, our first game plan, focuses on the Opulens asteroid. In this plan Sphere 1 Revolves on Opulens and Sphere 2 Spins on Opulens. It is a plan that does indeed allow for the MAXIMUM POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF POINTS FOR REVOLVING AND SPINNING IN A MATCH. At the beginning of Phase One, each sphere retrieves a laser and flies to Opulens. Then the spheres melt Opulens and for the remainder of the next two phases the spheres revolve and spin on Opulens. (23 pts. / 17 pts.) 

Simulation Sample

For teams that ARE NOT capable of revolving, and meet a team that can revolve, they would fly the High Capability Spin flight plan. If they are able to melt this would be the same as a High Capability team that happened to be Sphere 2. If they were not able to melt, they would simply go to Opulens and spin for the entire match, while the High Capability sphere melted the ice. 

Simulation Sample

When two Low Capability teams meet, they will be assigned resources to use at their discretion. We can't decide what is best for teams to do in this situation as cooperation is not really possible. 


HIGH CAPABILITY MATCH
High Capability Revolve (Sphere 1)
Objective: Revolving around Opulens cooperatively
-Phase 1: 
-Get Laser 1
-Go To Opulens (0.45,-0.6,0) and set Attitude to point to Opulens
-Phases 2 and 3:
-Fire Laser until Opulens is fully melted
-Revolve around Opulens until the end of the game
Total Points:
23 Points (Max Allowed by Game)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
High Capability Spin (Sphere 2)
Objective: Spinning on Opulens cooperatively
-Phase 1:
-Get Laser 2
-Go to Opulens (-0.04,-0.6, 0.0) and set attitude to point to Opulens
-Phases 2 and 3
-Fire Laser until Opulens is fully melted
-Spin on Opulens until the end of the game
Total Points: 17 Points (if you can get more without revolving... we'll talk.) 







MIXED CAPABILITY MATCH
High Capability Revolve (High Capability Sphere - 1 or 2)
Objective: Revolving around Opulens cooperatively
-Phase 1: 
-Get Laser (Sphere 1 - Laser 1, Sphere 2 - Laser 2)
-Go To Opulens (-0.45,-0.6,0) for Sphere 1 or (+0.45,-0.6,0) for Sphere 2 and set Attitude to point to Opulens
-Phases 2 and 3:
-Fire Laser until Opulens is fully melted
-Revolve around Opulens until the end of the game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Low Capability Spin (Low Capability Sphere - 1 or 2)
Objective: Spin on Opulens cooperatively
-Option A 
-Phase 1
-Get Laser (if you can help melt)(Sphere 1 - Laser 1, Sphere 2 - Laser 2)
-Go to Opulens (0.04,-0.6, 0.0) for sphere 1 or (-0.04,-0.6, 0.0) for sphere 2 and set attitude to point to Opulens
or
-Go Directly To Opulens (0.0,-0.6,0) and spin
-Phases 2 and 3
-Help melt if you can
-Spin on Opulens for remainder of match
-Total for Revolving: 17 points (with NO help melting)
-Total for Spinning: 14 points (with NO help melting)




Low Capability Match
Sphere 1 is granted rights to Opulens, Laser 1 and Mining station 1. 
Sphere 2 is granted rights to Indigens, Laser 2 and Mining station 2.
