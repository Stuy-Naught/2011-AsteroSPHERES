Vinay and Rene's submission: Comprehensive_Strategy.c (Github),\
orbit bot optimizing further (IDE)\
\
Mikhail's Orbit Bot Best, plus spinning, if the opponent is revolving at\
the asteroid you are on at 61 or 66 seconds.\
\
Communication to decide which mining station, which asteroid, with a\
limit to the number of times it can switch (bombardment-proof), and\
fully functional without receiving communication.  Is always honest.\
\
Uses leaveOrbit and timeToMS to exit orbit/spin, while using tractor\
beam to repel opponent.\
\
Switches asteroids only if opponent is spinning properly on Opulens\
and you are on Indigens.\
\
Gets laser->disruptor upgrade->shield if possible at the beginning.\
\
Problems: loses charge quickly, loses fuel if collision avoidance\
activates a lot.\
\
The current code size is 107%, but we have not optimized any of the\
new code. \'a0We will most likely simplify leaveOrbit, or get rid of it if there\
is something else we need to add.}
